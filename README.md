Why would we make the effort to split up our codebase into multiple modules when everything works just fine with a single, monolithic module?

The main reason is that a single monolithic codebase is susceptible to architectural decay. 
Within a codebase, we usually use packages to demarcate architectural boundaries. 
But packages in Java arenâ€™t very good at protecting those boundaries. 
Suffice it to say that the dependencies between classes within a single monolithic codebase tend to quickly degrade into a big ball of mud.
